        <p>Our prices and quality of work are the best in the area! Estimates are given based off of the square-footage of the fence as well as the type of stain
        to be used (Solid, Semi-transparent, or transparent). Additionally, we offer powerwashing for older fences to remove sediment and build up in the fence so that the stain can properly 
        seal the fence and thereby increase the longevity.
